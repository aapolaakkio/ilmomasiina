# Installation

This file contains installation and customization instructions for Ilmomasiina,
both for [production](#production) and [development](#development).

## Customization

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `dev` branch is currently used for major changes upcoming to Ilmomasiina 3.0. Significant instability and
> breaking changes are expected. If you maintain a fork of Ilmomasiina, we **strongly recommend** tracking `2.x` until
> 3.0 is more stable.
>
> We expect to release a version of Ilmomasiina 2.x in 2026 that will allow making most customizations from the UI,
> removing the need for most users to fork Ilmomasiina.

If you want to change any of the following, you'll need to modify the code slightly and
build your own Docker image (if using Docker):

| What to customize                                                         | Where                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hosting in a subfolder instead of directly at `https://ilmo.your.domain/` | build args                                                |
| Colors                                                                    | CSS variables (`--color-brand-*`) in your Tailwind config |
| Favicon                                                                   | `src/app/favicon.ico` and related files                   |
| Header title                                                              | `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRANDING_HEADER_TITLE_TEXT` env variable     |
| Footer links                                                              | `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRANDING_FOOTER_*` env variables             |
| Translations                                                              | `src/i18n/fi.ts` and `src/i18n/en.ts`                     |
| Timezone                                                                  | build args                                                |
| Default language                                                          | build args                                                |
| Payment currency                                                          | build args                                                |

You can of course make further UI changes, but that is not documented.

How build arguments are passed depends on your build method:

- [GitHub Actions](#github-actions): Workflow YAML file
- [Docker Compose](#docker-compose): Compose YAML file
- [Local Docker build](#local-docker-build): build command

**Note:** If you fix bugs or add functionality, it would be _very_ appreciated to
create a pull request to the Tietokilta repository so we can potentially integrate them
in our version. That also reduces your maintenance work when upgrading.

### Building customized Docker images

#### GitHub Actions

The easiest way to build and host your Docker image is using GitHub Actions. Your public repos
have free Actions time. The repository contains a workflow called
[`docker-build.yml`](../.github/workflows//docker-build.yml) that can easily be customized with
variables to build and push an image for your organization.

Simply [enable GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#managing-github-actions-permissions-for-your-repository)
for your fork and modify `docker-build.yml` as instructed in comments:

- Update `env` block as necessary.
- Change the repository names in `jobs.docker.if` to ensure the workflow runs;
  it's automatically disabled on forks to avoid unnecessary errors.
- Change other conditions in `on` and `jobs.docker.if` if you want to build on branch pushes
  or a different tag pattern. The `docker` is otherwise set up for either approach.

#### Local Docker build

You can of course also build images locally.

Variables in `.env.example` can be passed as build args, though don't include secrets there.
Anything that _requires frontend rebuild_ needs to be passed as a build arg and won't work as a normal env variable.

```
docker build \
  --build-arg SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 \
  --build-arg DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/ilmomasiina_build \
  --build-arg BRANDING_HEADER_TITLE_TEXT='Kilta ry ilmomasiina' \
  --build-arg BRANDING_HEADER_TITLE_TEXT_SHORT='Ilmomasiina' \
  --build-arg BRANDING_FOOTER_GDPR_TEXT='Tietosuoja' \
  --build-arg BRANDING_FOOTER_GDPR_LINK='https://example.com' \
  --build-arg BRANDING_FOOTER_HOME_TEXT='Kotisivu' \
  --build-arg BRANDING_FOOTER_HOME_LINK='https://example.com' \
  --build-arg BRANDING_LOGIN_PLACEHOLDER_EMAIL='admin@example.com' \
  -t ilmomasiina .
```

You can then use `docker push` to a host of your choice, or run the container locally.

## Production

There are a few ways to run Ilmomasiina in production:

- [Docker as Azure Web App](#azure) (used by Tietokilta)
- [Docker without Azure](#docker-manual) (same setup, should work)
- [Docker Compose](#docker-compose) (currently untested)
- [Without Docker](#running-without-docker) (not recommended)

Other prerequisites:

- You'll need to bring your own [email service](#email-sending).
- When running outside Azure and without Docker Compose, you'll need a separate [database](#database-setup).
- When running outside Azure, you may also need to setup [reverse proxying](#reverse-proxy).

### Generating secrets

You'll need to generate at least two secrets for Ilmomasiina, `NEW_EDIT_TOKEN_SECRET` and `FEATHERS_AUTH_SECRET`.

These need to be **different** secure random strings with enough entropy. You can use a password generator and
generate passwords with at least 32 characters, or e.g. run `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate them.

### Database setup

> [!NOTE]
> Ilmomasiina 3.0 no longer supports MySQL.

You'll need a PostgreSQL database, and a user with full privileges to the DB.
Instructions are provided here for [PostgreSQL in Docker](#postgresql-with-docker),
and both [MariaDB](#ubuntudebian-mariadb-installation) and [PostgreSQL](#ubuntudebian-postgresql-installation)
on Linux without Docker.

The app will automatically create the database schema upon startup.

#### PostgreSQL with Docker

Especially for development, running PostgreSQL with Docker may be the easiest option.

1. Create the data directory: `mkdir data`
2. Start a container for PostgreSQL. You can change the values for user/password/DB name; you'll need to put
   those in `.env` later.
   ```shell
   docker run -d \
     --name ilmo_postgres \
     -p 5432:5432 \
     -e POSTGRES_USER=ilmo_user \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<add a password here> \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=ilmomasiina \
     -v ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
     postgres
   ```
3. If you have the PostgreSQL client installed, try signing in: `psql -h localhost -U ilmo_user ilmomasiina`

#### Ubuntu/Debian PostgreSQL installation

1. Install PostgreSQL with `sudo apt install postgresql`
2. PostgreSQL should start automatically. Run `sudo systemctl start postgresql` if necessary.
3. Open a PostgreSQL session with `sudo -u postgres psql`.
4. Create a new user for Ilmomasiina:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER ilmo_user WITH PASSWORD '<add a password here>';
   ```
5. Create the `ilmomasiina` database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ilmomasiina WITH OWNER ilmo_user;
   ```
6. Exit the PostgreSQL session with `exit`.
7. Try signing in with your new user: `psql -h localhost -U ilmo_user ilmomasiina`.

### Email sending

Ilmomasiina needs a way to send emails, both for signup confirmation and user passwords.

SMTP providers are supported for sending email. Ilmomasiina uses Nodemailer.

**Note:** If Ilmomasiina is run without an email provider configured, email contents will
be printed to the console instead. This can be used for debugging.

#### SMTP

You can configure SMTP servers via env variables.

- `SMTP_HOST` = SMTP server
- `SMTP_PORT` = SMTP port, typically 25, 465 or 587
- `SMTP_USER` = SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` = SMTP password
- `SMTP_TLS` = typically `true` if using TLS (port 465), `false` otherwise
  - Requiring STARTTLS is not currently supported - PRs welcome

**Note:** Using your own mail server gets you labelled as spam easily and should be avoided in production. User-facing email providers like Google might also not want you sending automatic email via them.

### Azure

Tietokilta uses Azure to run Ilmomasiina. Azure gives credits for free to non-profits which should be enough for this.

Azure recently reduced free credits to $2000, which is barely enough to run a production-grade App Service (P1v2/P0v3).
B-tier App Service Plans have been tried and at least B1 doesn't seem to handle load well.

1. **Optional:** Build and push a [customized Docker image](#customization), if necessary.
2. Create an _Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server_ (resource category _Databases_).
   - _Basics_ step: ([screenshot](./screenshots/db-basics.png))
     - _Server name:_ Choose freely.
     - _Region:_ Choose freely, but probably Europe.
     - _PostgreSQL version:_ 15
     - _Workload type:_ Development
     - _Compute + storage:_ Choosing Development should pick you a B-tier SKU. We're not entirely sure if these have enough performance in practice.
     - _Authentication method:_ PostgreSQL authentication only
     - _Admin username:_ Choose freely.
     - _Admin password:_ Choose freely & save for later.
   - _Networking_ step:
     - _Connectivity method:_ Public
     - Check _Allow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this server_
   - _Security_ and _Tags_ can be skipped
3. From the _Databases_ page, create a database on that server.
   - The name can be chosen freely.
4. **Recommended:** Create a user on the server and grant access to the database.
   - You can technically also use the PostgreSQL admin user if you don't use the database for anything else.
   - This requires connecting to the database manually:
     1. From the _Networking_ page, under _Firewall rules_, add a rule for _current client IP address_ and save. Wait a bit for the changes to apply.
     2. From the _Connect_ tab, copy the `psql` command to your shell:

        ```shell
        psql -h {postgres-server-name}.postgres.database.azure.com -p 5432 -U {admin_user_name} {db_name}
        ```

        - This all-in-one command is under _Connect from browser or locally_. You can also use the variant with environment variables.
        - The portal was a bit buggy for me and I needed to add the database name manually.

     3. Create a new user for Ilmomasiina:
        ```sql
        CREATE USER ilmo_user WITH PASSWORD '<add a password here>';
        ```
     4. Grant access to the database for the new user:
        ```sql
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO ilmo_user;
        ```
     5. Exit the PostgreSQL session with `exit`.
     6. Try signing in with your new user: replace your admin username in the `psql`
        command with the new user (above: `ilmo_user`).

5. Create an _Azure Web App_ (resource category _Web_).
   - _Basics_ step: ([screenshot](./screenshots/web-app-basics.png))
     - _Web App name:_ Choose freely, will appear in your URLs as `https://{your-app-name}.azurewebsites.net/`.
     - _Publish:_ Docker Container
     - _Operating System:_ Linux
     - _Region:_ Choose freely, but probably same as your database.
     - _Linux Plan:_ Reuse an existing one or create a new one.
     - _Pricing plan:_ B2 has been tested and isn't very performant. You may want to go for P1v2/P0v3 if your budget allows.
   - _Database_ step can be skipped
   - _Docker_ step: ([screenshot](./screenshots/web-app-docker.png))
     - _Options:_ Single Container
     - _Image Source:_ Private Registry
     - _Server URL:_ `https://ghcr.io`
     - _Image and tag:_
       - Non-customized Tietokilta image, latest stable version: `tietokilta/ilmomasiina:latest`
       - Non-customized Tietokilta image, pinned version: `tietokilta/ilmomasiina:2.0.0` (example)
       - Customized image, built in CI or uploaded by you: `yourorg/ilmomasiina:latest` (example)
     - If you use Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry, change these accordingly
   - _Networking_ step:
     - _Enable public access:_ On
   - _Monitoring_ and _Tags_ can be skipped
6. Read [.env.example](../.env.example). Set relevant variables as _Application settings_ on the _Configuration_ page. You'll need at least:
   - `PORT` and `WEBSITES_PORT` must match (you can set both to 3000)
   - `DATABASE_URL` = PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. `postgresql://ilmo_user:password@host:5432/ilmomasiina?sslmode=require`)
   - `NEW_EDIT_TOKEN_SECRET` = secure random string (see [_Generating secrets_](#generating-secrets))
   - `FEATHERS_AUTH_SECRET` = secure random string (see [_Generating secrets_](#generating-secrets))
   - `MAIL_FROM` = "From" email for system messages
   - `SMTP_*` for email credentials (see [_Email sending_](#email-sending))
   - `BASE_URL` = `https://{your-app-name}.azurewebsites.net/`
   - `BRANDING_MAIL_FOOTER_TEXT` and `BRANDING_MAIL_FOOTER_LINK` (may be empty)
7. Access the app at `https://{your-app-name}.azurewebsites.net/`.
   - If something is broken, check the _Log stream_ page or read logs via `https://{your-app-name}.scm.azurewebsites.net/`.

### Docker Compose

You can use Docker Compose to run both a database and production container locally.
**Currently, we don't actively test this configuration.**

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of this repository. You can copy [.env.example](../.env.example) to begin and read the instructions within.
2. **Optional:** Modify `args` in `docker-compose.prod.yml` for frontend customization.
3. **Optional:** Make [customizations](#customization) in other files if necessary.
4. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up` manually or e.g. via `systemd`.
5. Access the app at <http://localhost:8000>.
6. If you get `UntrustedHost` errors from Auth.js, set `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` in your `.env` file.

### Docker (manual)

If you don't want to use Docker Compose, or already have a database, you can run a plain Docker container locally.

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of this repository. You can copy [.env.example](../.env.example) to begin and read the instructions within.
2. **Optional:** Make [customizations](#customization) in other files if necessary.
   - After this, build your customized image via [GitHub Actions](#github-actions) or [locally](#local-docker-build).
3. Run the container manually or with e.g. `systemd`.

   ```
   docker run -it --rm --init --env-file=.env -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/tietokilta/ilmomasiina:latest
   ```

   - You might have to add stuff here to e.g. allow database connections.
     - In particular, `--network host` allows connecting to a database running on `localhost` on the host machine. Remove `-p 3000:3000` when using this.
   - If running behind a reverse proxy, set `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` in your `.env` to avoid Auth.js `UntrustedHost` errors.
   - This runs a non-customized Tietokilta image from the latest stable version. For other options, replace `ghcr.io/tietokilta/ilmomasiina:latest` with:
     - Non-customized Tietokilta image, pinned version: `ghcr.io/tietokilta/ilmomasiina:2.0.0` (example)
     - Customized image, built in CI or uploaded by you: `ghcr.io/yourorg/ilmomasiina:latest` (example)
     - Locally built image: `ilmomasiina` (what was after `-t` in `docker build`)

4. Access the app at <http://localhost:3000>.

### Running without Docker

You can also set up a production deployment without Docker. **This method is not recommended.**

1. Install a suitable Node version (e.g. using nvm).
2. Run `corepack enable`, then `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file at the root of this repository. You can copy [.env.example](../.env.example) to begin and read the instructions within.
4. **Optional:** Make [customizations](#customization) in other files if necessary.
5. Run `pnpm build` to build the Next.js application.
6. Use e.g. `systemd` or `pm2` to run the server process:
   ```
   pnpm start
   ```
7. Access the app at <http://localhost:3000>.

### Reverse proxy

If you want to serve ilmomasiina from a subdirectory of your website, you need to set up reverse proxying.

This will also require changing the `PATH_PREFIX` env variable when building the frontend or container.

The examples assume `/ilmo/` is the subdirectory and `PORT` is 3000 - adjust accordingly if needed.

The examples use the backend server to serve the frontend files, which is less efficient than using
a proper web server to serve them. (PRs welcome with instructions on how to set up a better method.)

#### Apache + `mod_proxy`

This approach requires access to Apache config.

```apache
# proxy https://your.website/ilmo/whatever to http://127.0.0.1:3000/whatever
<Location "/ilmo/">
  ProxyPass "http://127.0.0.1:3000/"
</Location>
```

#### Apache + `mod_rewrite`

This approach works both in `.htaccess` (with suitable `AllowOverride`s) or Apache config.
In Apache config, you may need to change the rules slightly.

It can use either the backend server or Apache to also serve the frontend files.
If Apache is to be used, the built frontend must be placed in the folder. **(untested)**

```apache
RewriteEngine On

# redirect https://your.website/ilmo to https://your.website/ilmo/
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^ilmo$ ilmo/ [NC,R=301,L]

# always proxy https://your.website/ilmo/ to http://127.0.0.1:3000/
RewriteRule ^ilmo/(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:3000/$1 [P,L]

# proxy https://your.website/ilmo/whatever to http://127.0.0.1:3000/whatever,
# but only if the file doesn't exist in the webroot
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ilmo/(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:3000/$1 [P,L]
```

## Development

In development, we recommend [running _without_ Docker](#running-without-docker-1). It's easier to use in most cases,
but you'll need to [set up your own database](#database-setup). That is easiest to do [with Docker](#postgresql-with-docker).

There's also a [Docker Compose setup](#docker-compose-1) with some significant drawbacks.

### Running without Docker

1. Install a suitable Node version (e.g. using nvm).
2. Install a database.
   - See [_Database setup_](#database-setup) for instructions on setting up PostgreSQL.
   - You can also use Docker for a database.
3. Create a `.env` file at the root of this repository. You can copy [.env.example](../.env.example) to begin and read the instructions within.
4. Run `corepack enable`, then `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start the Next.js development server.
6. Access the app at <http://localhost:3000>.

### Docker Compose

The entire development setup can also be run within Docker using Docker Compose. The
[docker-compose dev setup](../docker-compose.yml) is located at the root of this repository, and contains a
pre-configured PostgreSQL server, so an external database server is not required.

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of this repository. You can copy [.env.example](../.env.example) to begin and read the instructions within.
2. Go to the repository root and run `docker-compose up`. This builds the dev container and starts the frontend and
   backend servers in parallel.
3. Access the app at <http://localhost:3000>.

Due to how the dev Docker is set up, you will still need to rebuild the development image if you change the
dependencies or package.json. You'll also need Node.js and pnpm installed locally to do that.

### Test database setup

To run tests, you'll likely want another test database so test data doesn't clutter your manual development database.

1. Follow the same steps as in [the usual database setup](#database-setup), but name the database something different. This example uses `ilmo_test`.
2. Create a `.env.test` file at the root of this repository (you can start from `.env.test.example`). Assuming your test database runs on the same PostgreSQL server, set `DATABASE_URL` to point to the test database. Copy the same secrets as in `.env` (including `AUTH_SECRET`). Playwright calls `POST /api/test/session` to mint a real Auth.js session cookie for seeded users (not available when `NODE_ENV=production`).
   - **Make absolutely sure you're not pointing `DATABASE_URL` at an important database.**
